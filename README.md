# About this Project
I am simply roaming around internet to learn basics on stripe payments and webhooks. So found a interesting video tutorial series on service oriented subscription. 
* A user can subscribe to premium posts or can see free posts.
* A user can take subscription plan on monthly/yearly basis.
* They can change between the plans
* They can cancel the plans
* A inactive customer can make him active just by taking a plan and also his plan will shows up and vice versa.
